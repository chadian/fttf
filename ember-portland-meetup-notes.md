# building ambitious applications
## Ember is the SDK for the web
### We're building in so many different environments already
- 🖥  `ember-electron`(see [Ghost Desktop](https://github.com/tryghost/Ghost-Desktop))
- 📱 `ember cordova`, `ember-cli-cordova`
- ⤴️ `ember-cli-deploy`
- ... and `fastboot`

# FastBoot

## progressive enhancement for ambitious web apps.

# The difference between

# And...

# Progressive Enhancement (the obvious win)

```sh
curl https://ember-fastboot.com

```html
  <body>
    
    <!-- EMBER RENDERED CONTENT! -->
    <div id="ember4704" class="ember-view"><div id="ember4719" class="ember-view liquid-container"><div id="ember4730" class="ember-view liquid-child"><div id="ember4735" class="ember-view main-hero"><div>

    ...
    
    <!-- the ember js payload -->
    <script src="https://fastboot-website-herokuapp-com.global.ssl.fastly.net/assets/vendor-7f3caf99c54521a2a6d4bd2969a9e9c1.js"></script>

  </body>
```
- The javascript payload *boots*, takes over (rips out initial render), and you're live

# The route
## `/posts/:post_slug?includeMagic=true`

- Captures state
  - Matches on express request
  - Matches on FastBoot `app.visit`
  - Matches on ember-app

... *getting the router right*
*#bethebark*

---

# What else can we do on this request/response trip through Ember FastBoot (nodeland)?
## Think about
- **state**
- **presentation** of state
- **consumers** of state
- **process** by which state is consumed
- *available resources*

# Case study: e-mail 💌
- 🔌  power of existing components
- 🔌 power of existing addons (`ember-i18n`)
- 🚜 configuration via node `process.env`
  - bring in your API keys and configuration
- 🛠 build fast and on the fly 👐🏽 *via ember serve*
- email = no external stylesheets
- `express` middleware is your 🏭 assembly line
- ❤️ the route

- `ember`➡️ `ember-cli-fastboot` ➡️ `express.use` middleware ➡️ `cheerio` + `juice` ➡️ `mailgun`

# Dear Diary 😈🔥
1. Prototype it -- *(`ember-cli`, `ember-bootstrap`)*
2. Oh, that API -- *github profile picture with `ember-network`*
3. Existing data -- *pull it in (mongo via npm and shoebox)*
4. Make it pretty -- `ember-moment` and `ember-remarkable`
5. Paginate it -- `ember-cli-pagination`
6. I want to add posts -- *`post` via `express` middleware`
8. ... profit 💸
7. ... move existing data to express middleware and build out API?
8. ... more profit 💸💰💵

# Tips and gotchas 💡🙈

- `ember fastboot --serve-assets`, *basic fastboot app server*
- Avoid `jQuery` and relying on `DOM` manipulation as much as possible
  - mind the hooks 🎣: `init`, `didReceiveAttrs`, `didUpdateAttrs`, `willRender` and `willUpdate`
- Your initial UI feels "ready", it isn't
  - consider disabled states on elements, and temporary indicators

---

# Tips and gotchas 💡🙈
- Forget "ajax". Use `ember-network`, `fetch` spec and it's "isomorphic"
- Whitelist node modules in `package.json`
- Clean frontendy things from the build in `ember-cli-build.js`
```
if (!process.env.EMBER_CLI_FASTBOOT) {}
```
- Specific initializers: `app/initializers/fastboot`, `app/initializers/browser`
  - with `fastboot-filter-initializers`  

---

# Tips and gotchas 💡🙈
## `FastBoot`
- Global, it's just there
- Only available in FastBoot runtime
- `require`

## `fastboot: Ember.inject.service()`
- Ember service available in browser and FastBoot runtimes
- `isFastBoot`
- `response`
- `request`
- `shoebox`
- `deferRendering`

--- 

# Tips and gotchas 💡🙈
- you're in nodeland, go nuts
- Environment variables at FastBoot runtime
```js
if (fastboot.get('isFastBoot')) {
  Ember.get(FastBoot.require('process'), 'env.ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE')
}
```
- `nodemon` in your express app, watch your dist 
  - `ember s`, `ember fastboot`, `nodemon server.js -w . ../dist`
- Node debug or `node --inspect --debug-brk` (natively in Chrome with `node >= v6.3.0`)

---

# other ideas
- base64 inline images (and store in shoebox), wrap with a service
- static embeddable
  - simple html deliverable *(ie: messaging, )*
  - ember app to compose
    - same api
    - same ember components
    - fastboot renders and delivers
- hardware + other npm sources
  - don't require API wrappers necessarily
  - useful visual resources and feedback
- e-commerce
  - speed is key, take my money
- static sites / cms

---

# the future
- rehydration (we paid for that)
- ❓❓ spitballing here, fastboot templates ❓❓
- `POST` -- [Ideas are being tossed around](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/185) 
- ... and other cool stuff, come hang out in `-fastboot` on the ember slack

# [`fastboot`](https://github.com/ember-fastboot/fastboot)

```js
const FastBoot = require('fastboot');

let app = new FastBoot({
  // `dist` is the result of your build
  // via `ember-cli`
  distPath: 'path/to/dist'
});

app.visit('/photos')
  .then(result => result.html());

# [`fastboot-app-server`](https://github.com/ember-fastboot/fastboot-app-server)
##### `request ➡️  render at route ➡️ response`
- express + middleware
- before/after middleware hooks
- request render via `visit`
  - first pass within your FastBoot runtime (~ node)
